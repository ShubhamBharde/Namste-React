- we can create element using
  <b>React.createElement(tagname, attributeObjects, children) </b>
- finally we render using <b>.render()</b> method and in that pass our ReactElement

## Note :-

- ReactElement gives/returns object not html Element.
  & ReactDOM render() takes the object and convert to html element and put in to DOM.

- React methods:-

  - React.createElement(tagName, attributeObjects, children)

- ReactDOM methods:-

  - ReactDOM.createRoot(document.querySelector("#root"))

    - it create react root for dom

  - .render() method takes object from ReactElement and convert html element and putting it dom.

### Remember Permanent ..

- root.render() will replace the things to new one.
